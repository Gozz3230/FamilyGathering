Include in this doc the required information for your software reqs for your project as a whole.
Do some research on domain modeling and create your own diagram that represents your app. Here are some helpful resources as a starting point:

Include this domain model in the README.md file located in your project’s GitHub repo.

## Software Requirements

### Vision

- What is the vision of this product?
A media sharing site where your family can log in and download family photos or submit family photos. Permissions are managed for each family. (separate permissions for in-laws)

- What pain point does this project solve?
Social media sites now 'do it all.' this leads to cognitive overload, especially for family members that aren't computer-friendly. I aim to simplify social media for family sharing of wedding photos, family gathering photos, and family trip plans.

- Why should we care about your product?
MVP would be a site that requires login, stores a hashed and salted password, allows upload and download of images, and access to a calendar that can be edited

### Scope (In/Out)
IN - What will your product do
  - Describe the individual features that your product will do.
  - High overview of each. Only need to list 4-5
  - Example:
      - Users will be able to login and have read/write access based on authorization
      - Users can be a part of a 'family'
      - Users can add events to their family's page and RSVP
      - Admin users will be able to approve new family members and delete events
  - OUT: the product will not allow upload of images, just events and profile pictures

### Minimum Viable Product vs
What will your MVP functionality be?
What are your stretch goals?

### Stretch
What stretch goals are you going to aim for?

## Functional Requirements
List the functionality of your product. This will consist of tasks such as the following:
1. An admin can create and delete user accounts
2. A user can update their profile information
3. A user can search all of the products in the inventory

### Data Flow
Describe the flow of data in your application. Write out what happens from the time the user begins using the app to the time the user is done with the app. Think about the “Happy Path” of the application. Describe through visuals and text what requests are made, and what data is processed, in addition to any other details about how the user moves through the site.

## Non-Functional Requirements
Non-functional requirements are requirements that are not directly related to the functionality of the application but still important to the app.
Examples include:
1. Security
2. Usability
3. Testability
4. etc….

Pick 2 non-functional requirements and describe their functionality in your application.
If you are stuck on what non-functional requirements are, do a quick online search and do some research. Write a minimum of 3-5 sentences to describe how the non-functional requirements fits into your app.
You MUST describe what the non-functional requirement is and how it will be implemented. Simply saying “Our project will be testable for testibility” is NOT acceptable. Tell us how, why, and what.
